# Algorithm: Sum of Two Big Numbers Represented as Strings
## Inputs
- Two strings `a` and `b`, representing large numbers.
## Outputs
- The sum of the two numbers as a string, with step-by-step addition printed.
## Steps
1. **Initialization**
   - Convert strings `a` and `b` into lists `lista` and `listb`, respectively. Each list contains the individual digits of the number as elements.
2. **Prepare for Addition**
   - Determine the lengths of `lista` and `listb`, storing them in variables `lena` and `lenb`, respectively.
   - Initialize `rem` (remainder) to 0, to hold any carry-over during addition.
   - Initialize `step` to 0, to track the current step of addition from the rightmost digit to the left.
   - Determine `limit`, the length of the shorter number, to know when to stop the regular addition loop.
3. **Perform Addition**
   - While `step` is less than `limit`, perform the following:
     - Increment `step`.
     - Calculate `tmpsum` as the sum of the current digits from `lista` and `listb` being added, plus any remainder from the previous step.
     - If `tmpsum` is 10 or more:
       - Set `rem` to 1 (for the next step's carry-over).
       - Subtract 10 from `tmpsum` and insert the result at the beginning of `tmpresult`.
       - Print the step's details.
     - If `tmpsum` is less than 10:
       - Set `rem` to 0 (no carry-over).
       - Insert `tmpsum` at the beginning of `tmpresult`.
       - Print the step's details.
     - After reaching the end of one list, calculate the sum of the remaining digits (if any) from the longer list with `rem`, and insert it at the beginning of `tmpresult`. Print this final step.
4. **Finalize Result**
   - Combine all elements in `tmpresult` into a single string `result`.
5. **Output**
   - Print the final `result` string.
## Notes
- This algorithm handles the addition of each digit meticulously, including the carry-over, ensuring correctness for very large numbers that exceed standard data type limits.
- It prints detailed information about each addition step, including any carry-over and the final sum of remaining digits, which aids in understanding or debugging the addition process.
